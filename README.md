# Mantid Project Sphinx Theme

This is the official repository for the Sphinx theme used by the
[Mantid project](https://www.mantidproject.org).
It extends the [pydata-sphinx-theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/)
theme and overrides the default color scheme and navigation toolbar.

To include this theme use this line in your `conf.py` file

```py
html_theme = 'mantid_sphinx_theme'
```

And by including `mantid_sphinx_theme` as a requirement in your documentation
installation.
